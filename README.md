# Trading Journal

For my CS50x Final Project, I initially struggled to come up with a project idea. After completing the Week 9 Finance Project, I found it both interesting and relatable. Combined with the experience I gained from working on a Docker containerization project ([Inception](https://github.com/jdagz28/Inception)), I was inspired to transform my Excel-based trading journal into a web application with a graphical interface that fits my preferences.

The app will be built using a Docker-based microservice architecture for easier management and deployment.

## Features to be Implemented

- **Dashboard** – An overview of the user's portfolio, including the current value of investments and the total portfolio value.
